# Debian 13 sid Gnome gaming task <br>
auto-install.sh & extras.sh are scripts to install and configure the bare minimum to have a fuctionnal gnome desktop environement to build on top. This Debian installation can perform as good as any other gaming oriented distro's I guess... It have been tested against CachyOS and Ubuntu 25.04 and in both case this installer score a tad bit better using a custom TKG kernel 6.14+ .
